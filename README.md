# Jamboree-Admission-Prediction-Linear-Regression
This project analyzes student profiles to predict the probability of admission to top universities using supervised machine learning models. The dataset includes features such as GRE score, TOEFL score, CGPA, SOP, LOR, and research experience.

**Key Highlights:**
Performed comprehensive EDA to understand feature distributions and correlations.
Applied data preprocessing techniques including missing value handling, feature scaling, and encoding.

Built and compared multiple models:  
  Linear Regression, 
  Regularized Models (Ridge & Lasso)

Evaluated performance using:
  R² Score,
  RMSE,
  Cross-validation

Analyzed feature importance and interpreted model coefficients.
Provided actionable insights on factors influencing admission chances.

**Tech Stack:**
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

This project demonstrates strong fundamentals in regression modeling, model validation, and interpretability.
